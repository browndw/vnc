Description: Implements the Variability-Based Neighbor Clustering (VNC) algorithm 
    for bottom-up periodization in diachronic linguistics, based on the 
    work of Gries and Hilpert (2012) <doi:10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199922765.013.0014>. 
    VNC uses hierarchical clustering to identify periods of language change by 
    grouping adjacent time points with similar frequency patterns. Unlike 
    traditional approaches that impose arbitrary time divisions, this method 
    identifies statistically meaningful periods based on variability in linguistic 
    data. The package returns 'hclust' objects that can be used with base R 
    plotting functions or enhanced visualization packages for flexible dendrogram 
    creation and analysis.
